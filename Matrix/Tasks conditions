Tasks Conditions:

1) Above Average
The program should output n numbers for each row, 
the number of matrix elements greater than the arithmetic mean of the given row.

2) Matrix Trace
The program should output one number â€” the trace of the given matrix.

3) Matrix 1
A program that first reads the elements of a matrix one by one, then outputs them as a matrix.

4) Matrix 2
A program that reads the elements of a matrix one by one, outputs them as a matrix, 
outputs an empty row, and again the same matrix, but this time swapping rows with columns: 
the first row is output as the first column, and so on.

5) Maximum in area
The program should display one number - the maximum element in the shaded area of the square matrix.
In our problem, the shaded part is the left and bottom quarter of the matrix, 
where the quarter is the parts of the matrix formed by the intersection of the main and secondary diagonals

6) Quarter sums
A program that calculates the sum of the elements: the top quarter; right quarter; lower quarter; left quarter.
